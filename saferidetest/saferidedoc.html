  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>The NU SafeRide app is designed to enhance the safety and convenience of Northwestern University students by providing a free rideshare service that allows them to easily travel around campus. The app aims to streamline the process of requesting and tracking rides, ensuring students have a reliable mode of transportation, especially during late hours.</p>

  <h2 id="app-features">App Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ride Request:</strong> Users can request a ride from their current location to any destination within the campus boundaries. The app uses the device's GPS to detect the current location and allows users to select their destination from a predefined list or by marking it on the map.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Tracking:</strong> Once a ride is requested, users can track the vehicle's location in real-time, providing them with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) and ensuring transparency and safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Ride History:</strong> Users can view their past ride requests, including dates, times, pickup, and drop-off locations, to keep track of their travel history within the app.</li>
    <li><strong>SOS Feature:</strong> In case of emergencies, users can activate an SOS button that immediately alerts campus security, providing them with the user's current location and ride details.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback and Ratings:</strong> After each ride, users have the option to rate their experience and provide feedback, helping to maintain high service standards and address any issues promptly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="user-interface-design">User Interface Design</h2>
  <p>The app's interface is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, ensuring that students can quickly request rides without any hassle. Key elements include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home Screen:</strong> Displays a map of the campus with the user's current location highlighted. A "Request Ride" button is prominently placed for easy access.</li>
    <li><strong>Destination Selection:</strong> A search bar allows users to type in their destination, or they can select from a list of popular campus locations. Users can also place a pin on the map for more precise location selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Ride Details:</strong> Once a destination is selected, users are presented with a summary of their ride request, including pickup and drop-off locations, estimated wait time, and vehicle details.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety Features:</strong> The SOS button is easily accessible from all screens, ensuring users can quickly activate it in case of emergencies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="user-experience-flow">User Experience Flow</h2>
  <p>The app is designed to provide a seamless experience from the moment users open it to when they reach their destination:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opening the App: Users are greeted with the home screen, displaying the campus map and their current location.</li>
    <li>Requesting a Ride: Users select their destination, review the ride details, and confirm their request.</li>
    <li>Ride Tracking: Users can view the approaching vehicle on the map and receive updates on the ETA.</li>
    <li>Ride Completion: Upon reaching the destination, users are prompted to rate their ride and provide any feedback.</li>
  </ul>
